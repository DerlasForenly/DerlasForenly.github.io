        About compressor: A compressor is a mechanical device that \
        increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. An \
        air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor.\
        Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure \
        on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. \
        As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of \
        a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be \
        compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and \
        transport liquids.\n\
        Many compressors can be staged, that is, the fluid is compressed \
        several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. \
        Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, \
        to accommodate the already compressed gas. Each stage further \
        compresses the gas and increases pressure.",
